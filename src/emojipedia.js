    emoji: "🤓",
    name: "Nerd Emoji",
    meaning:
      "Nerd emoji 🤓 is a face with big glasses, an awkward smile and buck teeth. It's often used in a humorous or ironic way to describe nerds or to express how smart you are. It represents the stereotype of the nerd, an intelligent but oddly dressed person with social deficits. Although this emoji is often used by people who pejoratively refer to themselves as nerds, in some cases the combination of nerd glasses and buck teeth can also evoke anti-Asian stereotypes. The fact that the default color is yellow reinforces this problematic representation. Some platforms have revised the nerd emoji over time to remove the buck teeth, possibly in recognition of the potential harm this representation can cause."
